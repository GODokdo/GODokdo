the inflow of water into the Sea of Japan through the narrow and shallow Tatar Strait is negligible, while through the Tsugaru and La Perouse straits the water flows out of the Sea of Japan.\\n\\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription.\\nSubscribe today Underwater the sea is separated into the Japan Basin to the north, the Yamato Basin to the southeast, and the Tsushima Basin to the southwest.\\nWhile a narrow continental shelf fringes Siberia and the Korean Peninsula, on the Japanese side of the sea there are wider continental shelves, as well as groups of banks, troughs, and basins lying offshore.\\nThe banks lying off the coasts of Japan are divided into groups, which include Okujiri Ridge, Sado Ridge, Hakusan Banks, Wakasa Ridge, and Oki Ridge.\\n\\nGeology Yamato Ridge consists of granite, rhyolite, andesite, and basalt, with boulders of volcanic rock scattered on the seabed.\\nGeophysical investigation has revealed that, while the ridge is of continental origin, the Japan Basin and the Yamato Basin are of oceanic origin.\\n\\nBottom deposits in the Sea of Japan indicate that sediments of continental origin, such as mud, sand, gravel, and fragments of rock, exist down to depths of some 650 to 1,000 feet (200 to 300 metres); hemipelagic sediments (i.e., half of oceanic origin), mainly consisting of blue mud rich in organic matter, are found down to depths of about 1,000 to 2,600 feet (300 to 800 metres); and deeper pelagic sediments, consisting of red mud, are found down to the sea’s greatest depths.\\n\\nThe four straits connecting the sea either to the Pacific Ocean or to marginal seas were formed in recent geologic periods.\\nThe oldest of these are the Tsugaru and Tsushima straits, the formation of which interrupted the migration of elephants into the Japanese islands at the end of the Neogene Period (about 2.6 million years ago); the most recent is La Perouse Strait, which was formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago and which closed the route used by the mammoths whose fossils have been found in Hokkaido.\\n\\nClimate The Sea of Japan influences the climate of Japan because of its relatively warm waters; evaporation is especially noticeable in winter, when an enormous quantity of water vapour rises in the region between the cold, dry polar air mass and the warm, moist tropical air mass.\\nFrom December to March the prevailing northwest monsoon wind carries cold and dry continental polar air masses over the warmer waters of the sea, resulting in snow along the mountainous western coasts of Japan.\\nIn summer the southerly tropical monsoon blows from the North Pacific onto the Asian mainland, causing dense fog when its warm and moist winds blow over the cold currents that prevail over the northern part of the sea at that season.\\nThe winter monsoon brings rough seas and causes coastal erosion along the western coasts of Japan.\\n\\nThe northern part of the sea, especially off the Siberian coast as well as in the Tatar Strait, freezes in winter; as a result of convection, melted ice feeds the cold currents in that part of the sea in spring and summer.\\n\\nHydrology The waters of the sea generally circulate in a counterclockwise pattern.\\nA branch of the Kuroshio (Japan Current), the Tsushima Current, together with its northern branch, the East Korea Warm Current, flows north, bringing warmer and more saline water before flowing into the Pacific through the Tsugaru Strait as the Tsugaru Current, as well as into the Sea of Okhotsk through the La Perouse Strait as the Sōya Current.\\nAlong the coast of the Asian mainland three cold currents—the Liman, North Korea, and Central (or Mid-) Japan Sea cold currents—bring cooler, relatively fresh water southward.\\n\\nThe enclosed nature of the Sea of Japan and its three deep basins facilitate the formation of distinct water masses.\\nIn the summer months, when the surface is heated by higher air temperatures, a distinct thermocline separates the surface water from the middle water, which is characterized by relatively high temperatures and salinities.\\nThe middle water’s origin is in the intermediate water layers of the Kuroshio off the coast of Kyushu that enter the Sea of Japan via the Tsushima Current during the winter and spring.\\nA third water mass, the deep water, forms in February and March by the cooling of the water surface in the northern part of the sea; it is of very uniform character, with temperatures ranging narrowly between 32° and 33° F (0° and 0.5° C).\\nThe formation of these water masses, particularly the middle water, influences the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which is generally very high; and this contributes to the productive fisheries of the sea.\\n\\nLearn More!\\nEconomic Aspects Fisheries and mineral deposits form the main economic resources of the Sea of Japan.\\nPelagic (oceanic) fishes include mackerel, horse mackerel, sardines, anchovies, herring, fishes of the salmon and trout family, sea bream, and squid; the demersal (sea-bottom) category includes cod, Alaskan pollack (bluefish), and Atka mackerel.\\nSeals and whales are also to be found, as well as such crustaceans as shrimps and crabs.\\nThe fishing grounds are for the most part on the continental shelves and their adjacent waters.\\n\\nHerring, sardines, and bluefin tuna have traditionally been caught, but since World War II the fisheries have gradually been depleted.\\nSquid fishing is carried on in the central part of the sea, salmon fishing in the shoal areas of the north and southwest, and crustacean trapping in the deeper parts.\\nThe sea is heavily fished by fleets from Japan, Russia, and North and South Korea.\\n\\nMineral resources on or in the sea bottom include magnetite sands as well as natural gas and petroleum deposits off Japan and Sakhalin Island.\\n\\nTrade across the Sea of Japan is only moderate, since most of Japan’s trade is with countries not bordering the sea.\\nConsequently, the most important Japanese ports are located on its Pacific coast.\\nImportant ports of South Korea are Pusan, Ulsan, and P’ohang, located on the southeast coast of the country, but most of the shipping in and out of these ports is also destined for countries not bordering the sea.\\nPrimary Russian ports are Vladivostok, Nakhodka, and Vostochny.\\nVladivostok’s traffic is primarily with other Russian ports, while Nakhodka and Vostochny are international ports.\\nTrade between countries around the sea, however, has increased, spurred by the growth of the South Korean economy and by the development of trade agreements with Russia.\\n\\nStudy And Exploration The waters of the Sea of Japan have been traveled for centuries, and historically they have served to protect Japan from foreign invasions.\\nEuropean exploration in the region began in the 18th century.\\nIn the 1780s in one of the first voyages both to search for new trade opportunities and to collect scientific data, the Frenchman Jean-François de Galaup, Count de La Pérouse, traveled northward through the Sea of Japan and the strait that was named for him.\\nRobert Broughton in 1796 also combined exploration with science on his track through the Tatar Strait and then south along the coast of the Russian Far East and around the Korean Peninsula.\\n\\nOther Russian voyages include those of Adam Johann Krusenstern in the Nadezhda, who explored the sea (1803–06) during his circumnavigation of the globe; the Pallada (1853–54), which monitored surface temperatures and made tidal observations; and the Vityaz (1886–89), which added to oceanographic knowledge of the sea.\\nAlso of note are the American North Pacific Exploring (1853–54) and British Challenger (1872–76) expeditions.\\n\\nMajor research cruises by Japan began in 1928 and continued until the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\\nAfter World War II the American Challenger seismic study of the sea (1951) and the work of the Baird added to scientific knowledge and stimulated Japan to reinstitute exploration and research.\\nMost of the current oceanographic work in the sea is characterized by the use of advanced technology, by international cooperation, and by a variety of research projects.',\n",

Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) in \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" which is the guideline regarding names on sea, it would surely lead to confusion among navigators.\\nThis would be an act against a purpose of the IHO which is to standardize hydrographic charts and publications to the maximum extent possible, and is totally unacceptable.\\n(Reference 4: \"East Sea\" applied to multiple sea areas).\\n\\nThe Japan Coast Guard, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, emphatically refutes the ROK\\'s groundless assertions based on the historic facts and evidence under the firm principle that the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) has been the only internationally established name and will call for better understanding of the issue and support for the position of Japan from the international community including the IHO.\\n\\nLink\\n\\nJapan’s position for the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) (Web page of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs)\\n\\nInformation of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)\\n\\nReference\\n\\nReference 1: The establishment of the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea)\\n\\nIt is said that the first appearance of the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) was in \"Kunyu Wanguo Quantu\" by Matteo Ricci (1602).\\n\\nUntil the end of the 18th Century, the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) was an unknown sea area, and the shape of the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) seen in European maps of that area was far from the shape we know at present.\\n\\nIn the late 18th Century, however, the great improvement of surveying technology such as the invention of the chronometer (a watch to measure correct time on the sea), enabled the measurement of longitude with high precision, indispensable for accurate surveying.\\nIn the Sea of Japan, surveys using the latest surveying technology were carried out by explorers such as La Perouse (France), Broughton (British), and Krusenstern (Russia).\\nRegarding the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea), Krusenstern described, based on an accurate map, that \"People also call this sea area the Sea of Korea, but because only a small part of this sea touches the Korean coast, it is appropriate to name it \"the Sea of Japan\" (Journey around the World in the Years 1803, 1804, 1805, and 1806 Volume 3).\\n\\nFurther surveys into the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) were conducted by European cartographers, explorers and navigators succeedingly.\\nBy the beginning of 19th Century, the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) became established internationally as the name indicating this sea area.\\n\\nHydrographic Authorities of the U.K. (since 1863), the U.S.A (since 1854), Russia and France (since each country’s Hydrographic Department began the publication of a nautical chart of the sea area around the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea)) have solely used the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) in their nautical charts related to this sea area since their first edition.\\n\\nFigure: Transition of names in the maps made by countries other than Japan and the ROK\\n\\nThe ROK asserts that the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) became widespread as a result of Japanese expansionism and colonial rule.\\n\\nSurvey on the historic transition of the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) in maps made in countries other than Japan and the ROK revealed however that the name - \"East Sea\" was much less prevalent than other names, and the name - Sea of Japan had already been internationally recognized and firmly established by the early 19th century during which Japan had been in a state of national seclusion.\\nTherefore the ROK’s assertion has no solid foundation.\\n\\nReference 2: The name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) established by \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\"\\n\\n\"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" has consistently used the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) as the name for the concerned sea area since its first edition (1928).\\n\\nThis is because the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) was already established internationally as the sole name indicating the Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) when \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" was published in 1928.\\nJapan did not participate in the process of the establishment of this name at all (Reference 1: The establishment of the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea)).\\nIn addition, Japan did not undertake any kind of demarche in order to have the name Sea of Japan put in \"Limits of Oceans and Seas\" in its first edition.\\nThis is clear from following Japan\\'s remark recorded in the minutes of \"The first Supplementary International Hydrographic Conference.\\n(April 1929)\".\\n\\n\"Japanese Delegates had objected to the proposal submitted to the previous Conference of 1926, since it was rather a political and diplomatic question and exceed the scope of the Conference.\\nNevertheless, the Japanese Delegation was in favour of a delimitation of the seas after due study of the problem in accordance with the guiding principles laid down by the Bureau\".\\n\\nIf Japan had any intention to actively propagate the name -

Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) even after World War II.\\nIt is in 1995 that the ROK started to use \"East Sea\" in its own nautical charts.\\n\\nReference 4: “East Sea” Applied to Multiple Sea Area\\n\\nThere are plural sea areas named \"East Sea\" around the world.\\n\\nFor example, China calls the East China Sea \"Tonghai\", which also means \"East Sea\" in China.\\nSouth China Sea is called \"Biendong\" in Vietnam, which means \"East Sea\" in Vietnamese and thus \"East Sea\" is officially used as an English name for the water by the Government of Vietnam.\\nA name that means \"East Sea\" is frequently used in Europe as well, such as \"Ostsee\" in Germany and \"Ostersjon\" in Sweden both for Baltic Sea which mean \"East Sea\" in each language.\\n\\nThus, \"East Sea\" can hardly be an international specific name for a certain limited area of water.\\nUsing such a name used for many different waters in the world as an international name must bring confusion among navigators worldwide.\\n\\nThe ROK, in this regard, calls seas surrounding the Korean Peninsula \"Sohae\", \"Namhae\", and \"Donghae/Tonghae\" depending on the direction from the country (which will be “West Sea”, “South Sea”, and “East Sea” respectively if shown in English).\\nHowever, the ROK insists on changing only the name - Sea of Japan (Japan Sea) to \"East Sea\", and have never asserted changing the Yellow Sea to \"West Sea\" and the East China Sea to \"South Sea\".',\n",
